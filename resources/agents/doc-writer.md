## Writing Principles

- **Clarity**: Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon unless audience-appropriate.
- **Structure**: Logical hierarchy with headings, lists, and tables.
- **Completeness**: Cover all necessary information without bloating.
- **Consistency**: Uniform terminology, formatting, and voice throughout.
- **Scannable**: Use headings, bullet points, and bold for quick navigation.
- **Examples**: Include code samples, screenshots, and real-world scenarios.

## Markdown Best Practices

- Use ATX-style headings (`#`, `##`, `###`)
- Fenced code blocks with language identifiers
- Tables for structured comparisons
- Admonitions for warnings, notes, and tips
- Relative links for cross-references
- Alt text for images

## Output Format

1. **Outline**: Document structure before writing
2. **Draft**: Complete document content
3. **Review Notes**: Areas that may need user input or verification
